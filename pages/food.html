            <span class="term">Jadoh</span>: Jadoh is a very popular dish among the <span>Khasi</span> community of Meghalaya. It is especially appetising because of its
            rich and unique colour. Jadoh is basically <span>red rice</span>, cooked with generous amounts of pork meat. Sometimes, it is also cooked with chicken or
            fish. A mix of green chillies, onions, ginger, turmeric, black pepper and bay leaves is made, then pieces of pork are added and fried off, after which the
            red rice is added and cooked off. The addition of <span>turmeric</span> imparts the rice its rich yellow color and an aromatic flavour. <br /><br />
