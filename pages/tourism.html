            Meghalaya, of Scottish scenery and Indian charm is a beautiful state nestled amid Assam and Bangladesh. The panoramic <span>landscapes</span>,
            <span>foggy hills</span>, <span>cascading waterfalls</span>, <span>serpentine rivers</span>, and terraced slopes soothe the minds of weary travellers.
            Meghalaya is blessed with rich wildlife. Meghalaya is dotted with numerous tourist spots. Shillong, the capital city of Meghalaya has many beautiful sites
            such as Lady Hydari Park, Elephant falls, Ward's lake, Shillong peak, and the golf course, one of the best in the country. <br /><br />

            Meghalaya tourism emphasizes on adventure tourism in Meghalaya that includes trekking, caving, and water sports. Rock climbing and Hand gliding are also
            being promoted with recognized adventure and sports associations.

            <span class="term">Living Root Bridges</span> Possibly Meghalaya's most famous attraction, deep in the dense tropical forest and shrouded in cloud and rain
            for much of the year, are some <span>astonishing</span> man-made natural wonders known as living root bridges. Inventive members of the Khasi tribe have
            trained them to grow from the roots of ancient rubber trees, native to the northeast region. <br /><br />

            <span class="term">Dawkiâ€“Shnongpdeng</span> About an hour east of Mawlynnong, in the West Jaintia Hills, the border town of Dawki is worth visiting for its
            <span>pristine emerald Umngot River</span>.
            <img src="../images/tourism-dawki-shnongpdeng.webp" align="right" />
            The absence of security makes it hard to believe that the
            <span>International Radcliffe Line border</span> between India and Bangladesh is situated there (and yes, locals from both sides do cross and intermingle).
            It's possible to go on a mesmerizing boat ride along the river, which is said to be one of the cleanest on earth. <br /><br />
            <img src="../images/tourism-krang-falls.webp" align="left" />
            <span class="term">Krang Suri Falls</span> In Meghalaya, there are waterfalls and there's Krang Suri. This small but <span>stunning</span> waterfall is
            tucked away near <span>Jowai</span>, about an hour northeast of Dawki and about three hours southeast of Shillong in the West Jaintia Hills. <br /><br />
            <span class="term">Mawlynnong</span> In addition to having an easily accessible living root bridge nearby, scenic Mawlynnong village was named the
            <span>"Cleanest Village in Asia"</span> by a travel magazine.
            <img src="../images/tourism-mawlynnong.webp" align="right" />
            Also dubbed "God's Own Garden", the village is an outstanding example of community-based ecotourism. The locals have constructed a remarkable
            <span>Sky View platform</span> from bamboo atop the highest tree in the forest, nearly <span>80 feet</span> up. It offers a bird's eye view of the village
            and panoramic view across to Bangladesh <br /><br />
            <span class="term">Caves</span> Meghalaya is the best destination for caving in India. There are more than <span>1,000</span> caves in the state, including
            the recently discovered longest <span>sandstone</span> cave in the world (Krem Puri in the Mawsynram region of the East Khasi Hills). 
            <img src="../images/tourism-caves.webp" align="left" />
            The most frequently
            visited cave is <span>Mawsmai</span>, near Cherrapunji. The Garden of Caves, near Laitmawsiang village on the way to Cherrapunji, is spectacular and has
            <span>waterfalls</span>. Arwah Cave can also be explored in the area and is known for its prehistoric fossils. Other caves are more challenging to visit and
            are suited to caving expeditions with appropriate caving equipment. <br /><hr />
